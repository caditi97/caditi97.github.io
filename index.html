        <h1><span>Part 1 : Digitizing Circles</span></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The objective here was to design a program capable of digitizing circles.
          The conditions for the program were as described below.
          <ul>
          <li>The system should start with a single window containing a 20x20 grid of square points.</li>
          <li>All square points start with a color of grey which turs blue when a circle is made connecting
          the points.</li>
          <li>Center of the circle is the point user clicks and the edge corresponds to the point where the
          user releases the mouse.</li>
          <li>Two additional circles are created in red color corresponding to the largest and smallest radius
          of the highlighted points.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        </a>
      </div>

      <div class="fieldset">
        <h1><span>Part 2 : Toggling the Grid</span></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The objective here was to design a program similar to the previous part but instead here the user
          has the ability to toggle square points on and off. <br> Using the points toggled on by the user
          the program then creates a circle joining those points accordingly with the help of an iterative least-
          squares based algorithm.
          <ul>
          <li>Similar starting conditions to the previous part.</li>
          <li>A "Generate" button which creates circle using highlighted points.</li>
          <li>The algorithm used to create the circle should not rely on an external library or code to find best fit.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
